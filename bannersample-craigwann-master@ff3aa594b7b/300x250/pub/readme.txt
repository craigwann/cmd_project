This folder is the published files that need to be published or posted. 

All directory structure should be flat(no folders or sub folders). 

The main HTML file should be titled "index.html"

Generally Conversants publish size file limit is 200k (unless specified differently in the project Epic).

There should be a static JPG (40k max file size limit(not included in the overall 200k limit)) included in the folder.
